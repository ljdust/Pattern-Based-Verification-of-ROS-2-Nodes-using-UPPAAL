# Pattern-Based Verification of ROS 2 Nodes using UPPAAL
This repository contains the UPPAAL models that have been created for the paper "Pattern-Based Verification of ROS 2 Nodes using UPPAAL" submitted to FMICS 2023. 

## Paper Abstract
This paper proposes a pattern-based modeling and UPPAAL-based verification of latencies and buffer overflow in distributed robotic systems that use ROS 2. We apply pattern-based modeling to simplify the construction of formal models for ROS 2 systems. Specifically, we propose Timed Automata templates for modeling callbacks in UPPAAL, including all versions of the single-threaded executor in ROS 2. Furthermore, we demonstrate the differences in callback scheduling and potential errors in various versions of ROS 2 through experiments and model checking.
Our formal models of ROS 2 systems are validated in experiments, as the behavior of ROS 2 presented in the experiments is also exposed by the execution traces of our formal models. Moreover, model checking can reveal potential errors that are missed in the experiments.
The paper demonstrates the application of pattern-based modeling and verification in distributed robotic systems, showcasing its potential in ensuring system correctness and uncovering potential errors.
